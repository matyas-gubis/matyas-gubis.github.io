# Discord-like Todo list

When I started learning the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript, I thought that the best practice is, to create a basic todo list.
This consist of the usual CRUD operations.
However, I was not quite happy with a simple minus button as a deletion, so I decided to implement a discord-like hover event.
When the mouse is hovered over an already added task, the options "delete", "edit" and "move up/down" appear.
Simple clicking a task will mark it as done.

Throughout the making of this simple app, I recognised how tedious and harly readable can a natively JavaScript driven app be, and I decided to do a deep dive in React.
